# Introduction

The goal of this collection of links is to showcase the use of web annotations within a IIIF viewer. The [Mirador](https://projectmirador.org/) viewer will be used.


## OCR content

Optical character recognition (OCR) tools such as [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) provide a powerful way to generate annotation content. The results will vary depending on the source images. The following links will help highlight the challenges and potential for this approach.

* [Introduction to the Valor Ecclesiasticus](https://projectmirador.org/embed/?iiif-content=https://miiify.rocks/manifest/intro_valor_ecclesiasticus)

* [Diamond Jubilee of the Metropolitan Railway](https://projectmirador.org/embed/?iiif-content=https://miiify.rocks/manifest/diamond_jubilee_of_the_metro)
